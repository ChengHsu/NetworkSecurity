The idea of a wireless network is to provide easy access to end users, but this ease of access causes more attack threats such as rogue access points, denial of services, configuration problems, passive capturing at the same time. I think another weak point is that a wireless network only requires an attacker to be in a close distance, instead of physically getting access to the network when it comes to wired network.
