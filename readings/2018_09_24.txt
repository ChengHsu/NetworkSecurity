1.By reading Attacks of SYN Flooding, I get a better understanding of TCP/IP handshake,
in which the recipient sends out as Y an encrypted version of X instead of keeping a copy
of SYN packet.

2.I didn't know the difference between Trojans, viruses and worms until I read 21.3, which
specifies a Trojan is a malicious program, a worm is something replicates and a virus is a
kind of worm which replicates by attaching itself to other programs.

3.I can't see the difference between Misuse detection and Anomaly detection.

4.Since the encryption can be much faster than decryption in TLS, it is not a good idea to
let servers to do the decryprtion.
