1. For operating system access control, I think it's so efficient to create
groups so that we don't have to give specific access to each member of a system
because right of access control duplicates in a group of members who have the
same role.
2. I think the Sandboxing, which provides a restricted environment in which it
has no access to the local hard disk is actually a really convenient and harmless
 way to test the safety of suspicious code. It should be applied more widely.
