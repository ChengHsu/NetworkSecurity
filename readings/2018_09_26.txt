1.I'm confused about the difference between ARP poisoning and MAC flooding.
Since the poisoning is to update a host's cache with forged ARP entry and flooding
is to flood switch using ARP packets. I think the only difference is the amount of
ARP that is used.

2.In the 3.Layer2/Layer3 impact, Why would the a router identifies the new MAC
destination address for the packet ?

3.What's the difference if both AH and ESP provide authentication functions?
