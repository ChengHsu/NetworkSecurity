1. I think the an advantage of IPSec is that it is transparent to its applications,
and it has no impact on the higher network layers .Therefore IPSec is appropriate
for securing real-time traffic.
2. And the disadvantage to an IPSec remote-access approach is that once a computer
is attached to the network secured by IPSec, all of the additional devices attached
to that local network might also be able to gain access across the WAN to the
corporate network.  So it's possible that a worm could easily spread to other
drives on the corporate network.
